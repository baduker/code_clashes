You and your colleague work in a lab. The colleague does the dirty job of doing the tests. You, on the other hand, collect and write down the results.

The results of the tests always come is pairs e.g. 11 22 or 33 44 etc.

So, you store all of them consecutively in a single array - [11, 22, 33, 44].

This is all good but...

The chief of the lab likes to view the results of the tests in the following format with a specified delimiter of his liking. For example:

[11:22], [33:44], [55-66], [77-88], [99 & 11], [22 & 33] etc.

Your task:

Complete the function chop_it_up that takes two arguments:

an array of positive integers
and a string delimiter
and returns the result (as a string) as in the examples above and below.

chop_it_up([1,2,3,4], " vs. ") --> [1 vs. 2], [3 vs. 4]

chop_it_up([10,20,30,40], " | ") --> [10 | 20], [30 | 40]

Notes:

There's a preloaded list of your chiefâ€™s seven favorite string delimiters called: delimiters

The array of integers that's passed into the function will always be of even length.

Finally, you don't have to worry about an empty array or a missing delimiter. The minimum array length is 2 and there's always a single delimiter.
